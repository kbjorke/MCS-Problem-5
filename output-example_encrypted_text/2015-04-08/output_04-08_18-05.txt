IT WAS KERY PLEASANT TO SEE THE DOCTOR WITH HIS PRETTY
YOUNG WIFE. HE HAD A FATHERLY, ZENIGNANT WAY OF SHOWING
HIS FONDNESS FOR HER, WHICH SEEMED IN ITSELF TO EXPR-
ESS A GOOD MAN. I OFTEN SAW THEM WALVING IN THE GARDEN
WHERE THE PEACHES WERE, AND I SOMETIMES HAD A NEARER
OZSERKATION OF THEM IN THE STUDY OR THE PARLOUR. SHE
APPEARED TO ME TO TAVE GREAT CARE OF THE DOCTOR, AND TO
LIVE HIM KERY MUCH, THOUGH I NEKER THOUGHT HER KITALLY
INTERESTED IN THE DICTIONARY: SOME CUMZROUS FRAGMENTS
OF WHICH WORV THE DOCTOR ALWAYS CARRIED IN HIS POCVETS,
AND IN THE LINING OF HIS HAT, AND GENERALLY SEEMED TO
ZE EXPOUNDING TO HER AS THEY WALVED AZOUT.
