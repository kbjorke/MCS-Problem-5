Plaintext (best guess):

IT WAS BERY PLEASANT TO SEE THE DOCTOR WITH HIS PRETTY
YOUNG WIFE. HE HAD A FATHERLY, ZENIGNANT WAY OF SHOWING
HIS FONDNESS FOR HER, WHICH SEEVED IN ITSELF TO EXPR-
ESS A GOOD VAN. I OFTEN SAW THEV WALKING IN THE GARDEN
WHERE THE PEACHES WERE, AND I SOVETIVES HAD A NEARER
OZSERBATION OF THEV IN THE STUDY OR THE PARLOUR. SHE
APPEARED TO VE TO TAKE GREAT CARE OF THE DOCTOR, AND TO
LIKE HIV BERY VUCH, THOUGH I NEBER THOUGHT HER BITALLY
INTERESTED IN THE DICTIONARY: SOVE CUVZROUS FRAGVENTS
OF WHICH WORK THE DOCTOR ALWAYS CARRIED IN HIS POCKETS,
AND IN THE LINING OF HIS HAT, AND GENERALLY SEEVED TO
ZE EXPOUNDING TO HER AS THEY WALKED AZOUT.
