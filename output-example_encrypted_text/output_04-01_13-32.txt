Plaintext (best guess):

IT WAS VERY PLEASANT TO SEE THE DOCTOR WITH HIS PRETTY
YOUNG WIFE. HE HAD A FATHERLY, BENIGNANT WAY OF SHOWING
HIS FONDNESS FOR HER, WHICH SEEMED IN ITSELF TO EXPR-
ESS A GOOD MAN. I OFTEN SAW THEM WALKING IN THE GARDEN
WHERE THE PEACHES WERE, AND I SOMETIMES HAD A NEARER
OBSERVATION OF THEM IN THE STUDY OR THE PARLOUR. SHE
APPEARED TO ME TO TAKE GREAT CARE OF THE DOCTOR, AND TO
LIKE HIM VERY MUCH, THOUGH I NEVER THOUGHT HER VITALLY
INTERESTED IN THE DICTIONARY: SOME CUMBROUS FRAGMENTS
OF WHICH WORK THE DOCTOR ALWAYS CARRIED IN HIS POCKETS,
AND IN THE LINING OF HIS HAT, AND GENERALLY SEEMED TO
BE EXPOUNDING TO HER AS THEY WALKED ABOUT.
